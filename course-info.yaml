title: KotlinFlashKards - coroutines
language: English
summary: "This is a set of flash cards to practise Kotlin Coroutine syntax. It can\
  \ be used at regular intervals to strengthen long term memory recall of core syntax\
  \ patterns used in concurrent code in Kotlin. It covers Coroutines, error handling\
  \ and testing Coroutines. \n\nIt does not replace the documentation at kotlinlang.org\
  \ or a good book but is a supplementary source of practice material to practise\
  \ recall of the syntax and coding patterns."
