**Welcome to KotlinFlashKards for Coroutines**

This course is a set of flash cards to revise how to use coroutines. It does not replace the [documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) or a good book. It should be used together with other materials.

Coroutines are *the* builtin and *supported* way that Kotlin provides to do concurrency. It is worthwhile to know the language and library concepts to be able to fluently write code and think about concurrent problems and how they could be solved in Kotlin. 

**Why do this? Can't I just look up the syntax with AI or on the internet?**

These flash cards can be used to commit coroutine knowledge to your **long term memory** (LTM) so that it makes it easier to read code. This helps with code comprehension because it allows you to use your long term memory to **chunk** code elements. In addition if you don't need to look up coroutine syntax every time you use it, it will help you be able to write code quickly and minimise context switches caused by researching syntax.

Letâ€™s get started with some **tips** on how to get the best of this course.
