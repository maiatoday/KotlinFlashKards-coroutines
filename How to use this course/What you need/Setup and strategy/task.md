Let's Go

## Setup

All the libraries are included, so you don't need anything besides this course to run the code.

## Strategy

You could go through this entire course. An alternative is to pick lessons that interest you or that are areas that you know you have difficulties. 

### 1. Repeat at regular intervals
Memories are built up if you **repeat** the flash cards at **regular intervals**. It is better to a few lessons more often than to do many lessons in one sitting. You can do the course many times or choose which areas to practise.

### 2. Recall the answer before peeking
It is important to try to recall the syntax first before looking at the hints or letting the IDE help you. This means you practise your **recall** of the memory.

### 3. Think about the solution
For each question and answer you will remember it better too if you think of a practical place where you could use similar code.
